        \section{ABOUT ME}

        \raggedright
        I am strongly detail oriented and work best in small but passionate teams.
        \newline\newline
        Always passionate about aviation I obtained my private pilot's license at age 16. I also love travelling, skiing and learning new languages. 
        \newline\newline
        I am most interested in programming for applications that involve a lot of mathematical theory (robotics, finance, optimization, etc.).
